# Learn Chainlink! 🆑

Welcome to the official repository for **Learn Chainlink!**, the final project of batch 4. This educational initiative is designed to introduce users to the functionalities of Chainlink through a practical, hands-on tutorial that culminates in the creation of the **Flip The Coin Crypto** game. 🎲

## About the Project 📘

**Learn Chainlink!** is inspired by the methodologies of Speed Run Ethereum, adapted to focus on Chainlink. The project aims to provide users with a thorough understanding of Chainlink functions by engaging them in the building process of a predictive game based on Ethereum price movements.

## Challenge #0 - Flip The Coin Crypto 🪙

In **Flip The Coin Crypto**, players predict whether the price of Ethereum (ETH) will rise or fall within the next 60 seconds. This game uses Chainlink functions to access real-time data, and smart contracts to execute game logic.

### How It Works

1. Users place a bet on the future price of ETH.
2. After 60 seconds, a Chainlink function retrieves the current price of ETH.
3. Winners are determined based on their predictions compared to actual price movements.

## Tutorial Walkthrough 📖
